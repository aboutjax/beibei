        My partner in crime (Deanna) owns a hip little cookie shop called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoustacheNZ/">Moustache Milk & Cookie Bar</a> and their cookies are the bomb. Since I'm the non-business saavy half, I have been trying to make myself useful by doing bits and pices of design work whenever she needs them.

      <h2>Illustrations & Posters</h2>
      <p>The bus goes on a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd4LOqRlW-9/?taken-by=moustachenz">nationwide tour</a> during summer, so as part of that I have been designing social media posters when needed.</p>

      <p>Deanna often comes up with crazy ideas for the market, and we've been doing packaging design ourselves.</p>

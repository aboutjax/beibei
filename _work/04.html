        CookSafe was unfortunately a shortlived project. It did not make it to launch date. However, it still went through weeks of scoping & design before the plug was pulled, so I'll still share it anyway.

      <h2>Easier Food Control Plans</h2>
      <p>
        There's a common thread in the food & hospitality business â€“ Getting a food safety grade is a tedious, time consuming and repetitive proces. Not only do they need to print out a lot of forms, often they are thrown away if certain sections don't apply to their business, thus wasting a bunch of resource every year.
      </p>
      <p>
        CookSafe wants to simplify the process by taking the user through bite-sized question & answer interfaces rather than traditional forms. Through the answers, CookSafe can provide you with a Food Control Plan tailored to <strong>your</strong> business. Nothing more, nothing less. No more resource wasting and get on with running your business like a boss.
